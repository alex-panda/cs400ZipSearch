This submission contains the project two application.

I'm the data wrangler 2 and is responsible for the zipcode_clean.csv raw data, Place, and DataLoader class, as well as my own implementation of Red Black Tree.

This submission also contains code from Justin, Alex, and Xiaohan's work as back end, front end, and test module.

The Makefile contains scripts to run the program. The commands are:
run: execute the program for normal use
test: run testing suites for data loading, back end, and front end programs
clean: remove all compiled .class files
